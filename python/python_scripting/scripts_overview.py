"""SCRIPTING"""

# a script is a piece of code that automates a task.
# benefits: save time, eliminate human error
# Scripting is different to programming

"""
Programming is many files, big projects etc
Scripting is ONE FILE

Scripting has a limited scope, targeted on a limited task/action
Programming has a much more comprehensive scope typically

Analogy: if you need to resize a ton of photos in photoshop, you're better off writing a script to do that. You can do way more actions in photoshop, it's a fully fledged programme. But scripting that single resizing task saves time, and eliminates human error


Scripts are/should be easy to read. Programmes are complex.

Scripts are very rigid/specific. Programmes, given their complexity, are flexible.

Scripts are written in high level languages. Programmes are often written in low level languages.

The lower a language is, the more like machine code it is. The higher it is, the more like human writing it is.

# Why write scripts in python over other languages?
"""
EASY
LIBRARIES
LANGUAGE INTEROPERABILITY (it works with other languages, platforms, and systems)
LARGE COMMUNITY (in part because it is OPEN SOURCE) (A lot of the code we might need as devops engineers is likely already out there!)
"""

# Why do we care about scripting as DevOps engineers?

"""
We do a LOT of automation. WE make the release of software as efficient as possible.
Configuration (especially with the Cloud). ->IaC -> config management, orchestration (more on those later)

Here are just some examples of way we use scripts in DevOps:

Python script to query a database
Python script to execute a shell command or script
Query logs for alerts
Python script to take a backup
Python script for K8 containers
Python script to fetch I.P's of an autoscaling group
Lambda function to stop instances on a weekend
Python script for ETL jobs
Find the expiry date of an SSL certificate
Develop CLI applications using Python
Automating CRUD
Custom scripts for config management
