# DevOps Notes

DevOps is a set of tools and methodologies, but also a mindset.

DevOps is ultimately about trying to optimise and automate the software dev lifecycle to the point where the developers can push their latest iteration of code, and that will trigger the CICD pipeline, and a new increment will be released to end users within minutes.

However, to get to this point, an organisation will need to adopt and foster a culture that allows this to happen. The key tenets of this culture are collaboration, communication, openness to internal and external feedback, and continuous improvement.

DevOps is built on a foundation of Agile practices. A lot of the values and principles of Agile apply to DevOps as well, such as a focus on working software, continuous iterations and incremental releases.

The key business value that adopting a DevOps culture generates is a competitive advantage. Since one of the primary objectives of DevOps is getting software incrementally released as fast as possible, an organisation using DevOps practices will be able to respond to big changes and disruptions in the industry with speed.

The main goal is to get working software in the hands of the end users as fast as possible to generate value for the organisation.

Traditionally Dev and Ops were thought of as having a wall between them. The Dev team wrote code and came up with new features. The Ops team deployed the software and kept the software and the servers running. When Devs had a new release to be deployed, it was essentially them throwing it over the wall to the Ops team.

The Ops team love it when they have the software going and they can handle/manage it, and they don't want to be overwhelmed with calls about the software not working. Their ideal scenario is that they want the software that works to stay. They don't like the Devs team coming to them with a new version that they don't know works!

Devs had their own machines and systems that they would write their code on. Every machine might have had different settings. The devs were developing on systems where there were mismatched environments. Then when it came time to deploy, that introduces a new environment.

DevOps changed this and made the two teams work together more closely. Part of the DevOps role is about making sure that these two teams do work together well. It is also about **automating** the throwing it over the wall bit.

DevOps is also about setting up the Dev environment so that they match and have the same settings as the production/ops environment. When the software moves from one stage of the lifecycle to the next, the DevOps team make sure that the environments match and that the move goes smoothly.

_Note_: As mentioned, one of the main goals of DevOps is to get increments of software released very quickly. An **Incremental release** must be **working software**. At the end of a sprint, you may not have working software and so cannot release. If at the end of a sprint you **do** have working software, you may or may not choose to release it as an increment. The important point to mention is that incremental releases **must** be working software.
